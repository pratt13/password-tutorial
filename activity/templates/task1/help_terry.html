  <h3>Task 1: Help Terry</h3>
  The aim is to write a function that returns a list of all possible passwords that start with ("Qwerty", "Password", "Pa$$w0rd")
  and are suffixed with 2 random characters.
  Much like the Boyle task, a for loop is the friend here.
 Avoid getting bogged down in the details, you have a start which is one of possible three.
 Then you have a random character, then another random character.
 That is it.
